Socialize Site!!!

home page (navbar shows home, login, or signup

signup & login will be basic form input (may pass in hashed
passwords depends on how far i get)

Users page will be slightly different from Home

navbar will have home(will route to the main users page
instead), friends, and sign out (possibly more to come)
render the posts similar to the juke album set up but make it
block, not inline-block

maybe friends post & if so either together with username
identifiers or separated between pages entirely

if i make friends will have to set up a search bar to allow user
to look for others and send friend request (or just add, sounds
tricky)

might be better instead of the friends component to work out
individual post page

webpack-dev-server --config config/webpack.dev.js --inline --open"


class method Ideas:
 -list all friends
 -find mutual friends
 -find unread messages

 instance methods:
 -set up a new Message with opposite sender and receivers

 maybe load users to the home page, for my onEnter
